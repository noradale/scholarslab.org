### Introduction

My Name is Andrew Carl and I am an Undergraduate student that has spent an **absorbent** amount of time in the different makerspaces on grounds[^1] over the past couple of years. I have a deep interest in making things that has tied in with my general and academic interests. I think that one of the best ways to appreciate an object is to try and make it yourself.
