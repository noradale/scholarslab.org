Thanks to conversations with Brandon and his plan for his blogging (see his very good ["Year Of Book Blogging: Digital Humanities Pedagogy in Kind" post](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/year-of-book-blogging-digital-humanities-pedagogy-in-kind/)), I am also experimenting with my 2020 blog posts building into a larger project: possibly a book, or a book-like project trying to add to the many excellent argumenrs for non-book scholarship being better acknowledged, supported, credited; possibly something where I try to reject pressures to write a book and instead make another sustained piece of my scholarship in its best form. (Possibly something very weird shaped: I have a vague vision of something involving a mock-command-line interface on a website supporting choosing your own path through my research material, and something involving... bread recipes???)

Next month, I plan to publish a post on the topics I want to explore with this project. I'm using today's post to think through my motivations and questions about starting such a project.

## Following up on the [2019 Year of Blogging](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blogging) 
I have four goals for my Year of Blogging 2:

1. *To blog every month* (same as last year's goal), including *at least 1 post with a significant chunk of new writing* created during that month (new goal!)

Sometimes I blog to share writing I've worked on in other contexts, e.g. Brandon and I [annotated our past academic job talks](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/digital-humanities-job-talks/) and shared our talk-writing processes, Jeremy and I [shared a failed chapter proposal](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/software-licenses-feminist-queer-digital-humanities-practice/) for which we're still pursuing the research and a different publication venue, or recording my writing from a [month-long Twitter hashtag project](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/generous-thinking-hashtag-tweets/). I enjoy sharing this work, helping people understand it as scholarship, and making it available for learning and reuse by others. I'd like to keep doing this kind of blogging, but this year I _also_ want to make sure I'm making time to regularly draft _new_ text on whatever I'm currently thinking about. Ideally, that will mean most months have 1 "new" post and 1 "sharing something written for other purposes" post.

2. To use this year's blogging to *explore the idea of some large scholarly object*: possibly a book (e.g. with posts serving as drafts of chapters), or a book-like digital project, or something sharing a similar depth and breadth of scholarship but by experimenting through weirder forms and means than book or article.

3. *Encourage and support more SLab community members blogging* by working toward blogging being easier, more understandable, less risky feeling, more fun and communal (i.e. avoid the "pressure to blog" mistake I tweeted about [here](https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek/status/1221941935138537474)). 

This means working with folks to help them feel empowered to edit and add to our website: knowing what code does what, what things could break the site and what things don't need to feel like they could break the site, maybe even showing folks how to "break" the site then roll back changes and fix the site?

4. As a team, *consider hosting posts by external authors* through a themed CFP. 

In 2019, we had 6 colleagues outside Scholarsâ€™ Lab author on our blog (including 1 colleague outside UVA who was an existing project and grant collaborator, and co-authored a post with a SLab staffer). We've talked about inviting others to post to our blog, and have heard some interest in external folks wishing to publish here! We decided the best way to try this is issuing an open call around some specific topic, so we can let more folks know this is an opportunity. That will also give us a chance to publicly discuss how to do this well. Why publishing on our blog might be useful for external authors, e.g. reach a new audience, get a little blogging encouragment and feedback from us, a place to try out blogging if you don't have an easy other place to blog. And why we might want to publish folks from outside our local community on our blog: hear new ideas, practice encouraging and editing posts for other folks, share some of our resources (including the priceless resource regularly getting to chat in person with a large and friendly group of experts in varied areas).

## Book: scary?
I have three concerns I need to think through re:"is this going to be a book".

1. Am I writing a book for the right reason (because I have something I want to learn about and share that works best as a book)?  
2. Am I contributing to negative academic pressures to produce books by producing one?  
3. Can I create a larger piece of writing in a way I personally find pleasing, just, and useful?  

#1: 

refining my project purpose ties into academic pressures

and how deciding my format (why a book vs. something else?) overlaps with insecurity

If I dislike The Published Monograph being treated as a requirement for academic credibility, shouldn't I put my resources and job security behind making it easier to produce different kinds of scholarship?

#1 or #2
vs. all the work I already do that is not always read as scholarship, but is scholarship

For #3, here are some concerns I came up with while freewriting:  
* will anyone read it; will anyone enjoy it/find it useful  
* do i know how to write well enough  
* can i do enough reading and synthesis to support writing from my experiences  
* can i cite very well (as well as i think is ideal citation practice)  
* how much does finding the right publisher matter  
* can i make it something i'm proud of  
* does it need to be a book; do i want it to be a book  
* am i doing this because of pressures/perceived from above  
* is it good for the lab for me to have this experience  

Along these lines, I hope to post a current draft about my writing style: what I value about the ways I currently write, and what I want to either change or experiment with doing differently. I'll use some useful feedback on a chapter draft I ultimately decided to not continue revising for Debates in DH, and engage with some work around the kinds of speech choices that are traditionally advised against, but actually have a strong feminist purpose (e.g. being told to remove flags like "I think..." or "I feel..." from academic writing, when actually it's urgent that we accurately convey the level of familiarity, expertise, certainty with which we say what we're saying.)

## Book: good?
To do this well, I would like to:  
* Write/act/persuade/amplify the DH I want to see into existence  
* Write without any fear; don't write for audiences you don't care about and their qualms/caveats/pearl-clutching  
* Write for the people who have less justice and safety; imagine a more just world through this writing  
* Make a positive change possible via writing/amplifying/communicating ideas  
* Have an argument? (Maybe? Or write anti-argument, e.g. vs. Western canon focus on conflict as plot shaper; what could a book that rejected some forms of critique and argument positioning look like/do?)  
alternative framings: philosophy, vision, hope  
* Can I use my personal-story voice, the voice people respond to positively on Twitter that feels most like myself  
* Case study paired with analysis format outlined below might work well  
* Stuff that exists in the world and has helped me, e.g. collaborators' and student collaborators' bills of rights  

## Thanks
Thank Brandon
Thank colleagues (staff, students, faculty), especially Year of Blogging folks and new bloggers, but also folks contributing to a safe space to think aloud, try out weird ideas, experiment and fail. Given my relative security as a co-director, I will try to push some boundaries that should be pushed but are professionally risky undertakings. (like what??)
