Thanks to conversations with Brandon and his plan for his blogging (see his very good ["Year Of Book Blogging: Digital Humanities Pedagogy in Kind" post](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blog/year-of-book-blogging-digital-humanities-pedagogy-in-kind/)), I am also experimenting with this year's posts building a larger, possibly book or book-like project. Before I share what I'm writing about, I'm using this post to think through how 

refining my project purpose ties into academic pressures

and how deciding my format (why a book vs. something else?) overlaps with insecurity

## Following up on the [2019 Year of Blogging](https://scholarslab.lib.virginia.edu/blogging) 
I have four goals for my Year of Blogging 2:

1. *To blog every month* (same as last year's goal), including *at least 1 post with a significant chunk of new writing* created during that month (new goal!)

Sometimes I blog to share writing I've worked on in other contexts, e.g. annotating a past academic job search cover letter, sharing a failed chapter proposal, or recording my writing from a month-long Twitter hashtag project. I enjoy sharing this work, positioning it as scholarship, and making it available for the use of other folks. I'd like to keep doing that, but this year I also want to make sure I'm making time to regularly draft new text on whatever I'm currently thinking about. Ideally, that will mean most months have 1 "new" post and 1 "sharing something written for other purposes" post.

2. To use this year's blogging to *explore the idea of some large scholarly object*: possibly a book (e.g. with posts serving as drafts of chapters), or a book-like digital project, or something sharing a similar depth and breadth of scholarship without but through weird forms and means (what does this mean??)

3. *Encourage and support more SLab community members blogging* by working toward blogging being easier, more understandable, less risky feeling, more fun and communal (i.e. avoid the "pressure to blog" mistake I tweeted about [here](https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek/status/1221941935138537474))

4. *Consider hosting posts by external authors* through a themed CFP. In 2019, we had 6 colleagues outside Scholarsâ€™ Lab author on our blog (including 1 colleague outside UVA who was an existing project and grant collaborator, and co-authored a post with a SLab staffer). We've talked about inviting others to post to our blog, and have heard some interest. We decided the best way to try this is issuing an open call around some specific topic, so we can let more folks know this is an opportunity, and talk about what's useful about doing so for the lab and what might be useful for potential authors.

## Book: scary?
I have three things I need to think through re:"is this going to be a book".

1. Am I writing a book for the right reason: because I have something I want to learn about and share that works best as a book?  
2. Am I contributing to negative academic pressures to produce books by producing one? If I dislike The Published Monograph being treated as a requirement for academic credibility, shouldn't I put my resources and job security behind making it easier to produce different kinds of scholarship?  
3. Can I create a larger piece of writing in a way I personally find pleasing, just, and useful?

For #3, here are some concerns I came up with while freewriting:  
* will anyone read it; will anyone enjoy it/find it useful  
* do i know how to write well enough  
* can i do enough reading and synthesis to support writing from my experiences  
* can i cite very well (as well as i think is ideal citation practice)  
* how much does finding the right publisher matter  
* can i make it something i'm proud of  
* does it need to be a book; do i want it to be a book  
* am i doing this because of pressures/perceived from above  
* is it good for the lab for me to have this experience  

Along these lines, I hope to post a current draft about my writing style: what I value about the ways I currently write, and what I want to either change or experiment with doing differently. I'll use some useful feedback on a chapter draft I ultimately decided to not continue revising for Debates in DH, and engage with some work around the kinds of speech choices that are traditionally advised against, but actually have a strong feminist purpose (e.g. being told to remove flags like "I think..." or "I feel..." from academic writing, when actually it's urgent that we accurately convey the level of familiarity, expertise, certainty with which we say what we're saying.)

## Book: good?
To do this well, I would like to:  
* Write/act/persuade/amplify the DH I want to see into existence  
* Write without any fear; don't write for audiences you don't care about and their qualms/caveats/pearl-clutching  
* Write for the people who have less justice and safety; imagine a more just world through this writing  
* Make a positive change possible via writing/amplifying/communicating ideas  
* Have an argument? (Maybe? Or write anti-argument, e.g. vs. Western canon focus on conflict as plot shaper; what could a book that rejected some forms of critique and argument positioning look like/do?)  
alternative framings: philosophy, vision, hope  
* Can I use my personal-story voice, the voice people respond to positively on Twitter that feels most like myself  
* Case study paired with analysis format outlined below might work well  
* Stuff that exists in the world and has helped me, e.g. collaborators' and student collaborators' bills of rights  

## Thanks
Thank Brandon
Thank colleagues (staff, students, faculty), especially Year of Blogging folks and new bloggers, but also folks contributing to a safe space to think aloud, try out weird ideas, experiment and fail. Given my relative security as a co-director, I will try to push some boundaries that should be pushed but are professionally risky undertakings. (like what??)
